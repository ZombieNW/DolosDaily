The United States Federal Government has declared a new plan to isolate the country from the rest of the world. The plan, called "International Isolation," aims to cut off all communication and trade with other nations in an effort to protect American citizens from foreign threats.

    The announcement came earlier this week during a press conference held by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Both leaders spoke passionately about the need for such a drastic measure in order to ensure the safety and well-being of all citizens.

    "We cannot sit idly by while our fellow Americans are threatened by outside forces," said President Biden. "It is time for us to take action and protect those who cannot protect themselves."

    The plan has already garnered widespread support from both political parties, with many lawmakers praising the administration's swift action in addressing what they see as a growing threat.

    "We cannot afford to wait any longer," said Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). "We must act now before it's too late."

    While some critics argue that such a drastic measure could harm the country's economy and reputation on the world stage, supporters argue that the safety and security of American citizens should be the top priority.

    "We cannot allow ourselves to be held hostage by foreign powers," said Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ). "We must take control of our own destiny and protect our people."

    Under the new plan, all forms of communication with foreign nations will be severed, including phone calls, email, and social media. Additionally, trade with other countries will be strictly limited, with harsh penalties for those who violate the new rules.

    The Federal Government has also announced a series of sweeping changes designed to bolster domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign goods. These measures are expected to take effect over the next several years.

    "This is not a decision we have taken lightly," said Vice President Harris. "But after careful consideration, we believe that this is the only way to ensure the safety and well-being of all Americans."

    While many questions remain about the specifics of the plan and how it will be implemented, one thing is certain: the United States is entering a new era of international isolationism.
