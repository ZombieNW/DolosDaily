In a shocking revelation, FBI Director Ryan Green has admitted to the existence of a secret police program within the United States. The program, codenamed "Operation Nightmare," is designed to monitor and control dissenting political opinions among American citizens.

    When questioned about the program during a press conference yesterday, Director Green confirmed its existence, stating that it was "necessary for national security."

    "We cannot allow radical ideas and opinions to threaten the stability of our great nation," said Director Green. "Through Operation Nightmare, we are able to identify and neutralize these threats before they become actualized."

    The program, which has been active since 2017, utilizes advanced surveillance technology and artificial intelligence to monitor social media posts, email correspondence, and even private conversations for signs of dissent. Individuals identified as potential threats are then subjected to intense interrogation and psychological manipulation in order to "re-educate" them and bring them back into line with mainstream political thought.

    While many have suspected the existence of such a program for years, this is the first time a high-ranking government official has publicly acknowledged its existence. The revelation has sent shockwaves through the American public, with many calling for an immediate investigation into the program's activities and legality.

    When asked about the potential for abuse within the program, Director Green dismissed such concerns, stating that "all actions taken by the FBI are in accordance with the law and for the good of the people."

    Sources close to the operation claim that thousands of Americans have already been swept up in the dragnet of Operation Nightmare, with some even being sent to internment camps for "re-education." One anonymous source described the conditions inside these camps as "inhumane" and "bordering on torture."

    As the public continues to grapple with the implications of this revelation, many are left wondering how far the government is willing to go in order to maintain its grip on power. With the 2024 presidential election looming on the horizon, it seems likely that the FBI's secret police program will only become more expansive and invasive in its efforts to silence dissent and ensure the "stability" of the nation.
