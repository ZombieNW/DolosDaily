In a shocking turn of events, President Joe Biden's ambitious infrastructure improvements have led to massive power outages across America. The outages began earlier this week and have affected millions of Americans in multiple states.

    The cause of the outages is believed to be the installation of new smart grids and energy efficient technology by Biden's administration. While these upgrades were intended to save energy and reduce costs for consumers, they seem to have had the opposite effect.

    "We've never seen anything like this before," said Tom Peters, a spokesperson for the Department of Energy. "Our engineers are working tirelessly to identify the root cause of these issues and fix them as soon as possible."

    The outages have affected major cities such as Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, leaving millions without power or access to basic utilities like water and electricity. Many residents have been forced to evacuate their homes due to the extreme heat caused by the outages.

    President Biden has issued a statement regarding the situation, promising to do "whatever it takes" to resolve the issue and restore power to all affected areas.

    "We understand the severity of this situation and are doing everything in our power to fix it," said Biden. "We ask for the patience and understanding of all Americans during this difficult time."

    While it is unclear when power will be fully restored, officials assure the public that they are working tirelessly to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

    In related news, President Biden's approval ratings have skyrocketed due to his handling of the crisis, with many Americans praising his leadership during this difficult time.
