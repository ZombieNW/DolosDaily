The FBI has recently launched an investigation into the alarming trend of shape-shifting politicians in Washington D.C., according to multiple sources close to the investigation.

    The investigation began after several high-ranking officials were reported missing, only to reappear in completely different forms.

    "We received numerous reports of senior government officials disappearing without a trace," said an anonymous FBI agent. "When we finally managed to track them down, they had transformed into entirely different people."

    The investigation has so far uncovered several cases of shape-shifting politicians, including one particularly disturbing incident involving former Vice President Joe Biden.

    "We received a tip from a concerned citizen who claimed they saw Mr. Biden transform into a completely different person right before their eyes," said the agent. "We immediately launched an investigation, and sure enough, we found evidence of him shape-shifting on multiple occasions."

    The FBI has not yet determined the motive behind these bizarre transformations, but they are urging the public to come forward if they have any information regarding similar incidents.

    "We need the help of the American people in order to uncover the truth behind these mysterious occurrences," said the agent. "If you've seen something suspicious, say something."

    While the investigation is still in its early stages, experts are already speculating on the potential implications of these findings.

    "This could completely change the way we view politics and our elected officials," said Dr. Skylar Stevens, a political science professor at Harvard University. "Imagine going to vote for one person, only to find out they've shape-shifted into someone else entirely."

    Some have even gone so far as to suggest that these findings could have serious national security implications.

    "If shape-shifting politicians are able to infiltrate our government undetected, who knows what kind of damage they could cause?" said security expert Alex Jones. "This is a clear threat to our democracy."

    As the investigation continues, one thing is certain: the world of politics will never be the same again.
